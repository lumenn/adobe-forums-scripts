# Those are scripts written for users of Adobe Illustrator Scripting forums.

In subfolders you will find **.tsc** files, to compile:
1. Go into desired script subfolder
2. Type tsc
3. Result file will be found in **/build** folder

The **test** folder may be used to write short codes for checking things, put **test.ts** inside, and use *Test* debbuger.

Inside **.vscode** you can find prepared debuggers for each script, if you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
